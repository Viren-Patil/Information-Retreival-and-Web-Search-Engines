Assignment 1

The search engine assigned to my USC ID was Duck Duck Go

After running the 100 queries on Duck Duck Go, I got the following average values:

Avg. Overlap (%) = 13.8
Avg. Spearman Coefficient = -5.306

Hence, one can clearly see that since the Spearman Coefficient is highly negative which means Duck Duck Go and Google 
use different algorithms to rank their results and their results are highly uncorrelated.
Since Google is the baseline for this assignment, Duck Duck Go performed poorly (worse) in comparison to Google.
One can also see that the average overlap is only 13.8%, which means that the results that Duck Duck Go provides for the queries 
are matching with google's results only 13.8% of times which is very less.
This also gives us another evidence that Duck Duck Go uses an algorithm which does not give that good results as Google.
I also feel that another reason why Duck Duck Go is not giving good results is because it does not track users and does not 
show tailored content on the other hand Google does show us tailored content based on majority click through rate and user search patterns.
